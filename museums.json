The suspicion that the Red Army might have removed both finds was denied by the Soviets for decades. In 2004, a reporter from German magazine Der Spiegel located it in a secret depot within Moscow's Pushkin Museum. Germany has requested return of the materials, and the issue has caused tension between the German and Russian governments."

Later Schliemann traded some treasure to the government of the Ottoman Empire in exchange for permission to dig at Troy again."
